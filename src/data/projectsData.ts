    team: 'Individual Project',
    status: 'Completed',
    technologies: ['Python', 'Computer Vision', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Analysis'],
    
    personalMotivation: 'As someone who knows ASL and is half Black, wanted to design for underrepresented groups who would benefit immensely from improved recognition',
    
    technicalChallenge: 'Improving computer vision efficacy for darker skin tones that are typically underrepresented in training data',
    
    researchFocus: 'Recognition and distinction between ASL fingerspelling letters across diverse skin tones and lighting conditions',
    
    challenges: 'Addressing systemic bias in existing computer vision models, ensuring inclusive dataset representation',
    
    impact: 'More inclusive accessibility technology for deaf/HOH community, particularly people of color',
    
    note: 'Code lost due to laptop failure, may have final poster available',

    gameplayMechanic: 'Player discovers they\'re deleting evidence of civil unrest rather than neutral archival work, must choose between compliance and resistance',
    
    thematicFocus: 'Information integrity, archival power, resistance vs. compliance, historical erasure',
    
    narrativeWarning: 'Explores consequences of both compliance and resistance - not all revolutions succeed',
